      What does it mean to live life? That has been a thought popping up in my
      mind lately. Does life just mean to be happy or to pursue something
      bigger? I lost someone close to me recently... mabye it was just in my
      mind that we were close. I loved her, I adored her, and I made too many
      mistkaes when we were together. She seems to be living a good life without
      me in it, it upsets me but I am happy for her. Now back to the main issue
      within this blog post. What does it mean to live life?

      See I have been stuck with too many Dreams popping up in my head, and I
      never chased one NOT ONE. I was focused on getting back that person I lost
      and in the meantime I lost myself, and to no surpise I lost her with me. I
      just thought if I fixed our issues and won her back things will go back to
      being ok with me. And to be honest it would have for a small portion of
      time and things would go back to me being lost, just having a relationship
      to numb myself. To live life to me right now is to live for an adventure
      and to pursue your dreams and dive into the Unknown.
